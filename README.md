# PowerBI_SalesPerformance
Sales Performance Dashboard

This project utilized data sourced from a company, comprising three distinct datasets. The primary question addressed was:

"Account managers want to know how their customers are doing and which parts should they be pushing more?"

# Skills used
I began the project by conducting initial exploratory data analysis using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization. 
Since the data was initially unfamiliar, I utilized SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy within Python to execute SQL commands, enabling data slicing and exploration.

Transitioning to PowerBI, I employed various skills including conditional formatting, tooltips, establishing relationships, utilizing Power Query for data transformation, implementing drill-downs for deeper insights, and applying DAX calculations. Additionally, other PowerBI skills not previously mentioned include creating custom visuals, designing interactive dashboards, and incorporating advanced data modeling techniques.
